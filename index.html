                    <h2>The “talk me about yourself” question</h2>
                    <p>Where to start? What to highlight? Well, let me walk you through my academic, professional and volunteering story first – so that you can decide what to deepen after.</p>
                    <p>We always communicate something – it can be about any topic, anytime. In my case, I decided to communicate for a living, and here I am: writing and speaking about privacy, AI, data governance, neurotechnology and psychology through the lenses of culture and diversity. My goal is to contribute shaping the future of brain health technology in a more inclusive and culturally/socially relevant way.</p>

                    <h2>Studies</h2>
                    <p>I studied foreign languages (apart from English and Italian, I speak German, Spanish and Portuguese; French is on the way!), and international communication across Italy, Germany and Norway. My focus was marketing – including PR and advertising – and how people from different languages, places and cultures understand them.</p>
                    <p>A new product that needs to be adapted to different European or international markets? No problem – I got an analysis and strategy ready for this.</p>

            <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
            <section id="experience">
                <div class="container">
                    <h2>First work experience</h2>
                    <p>My first professional steps were rooted in digital communication and customer engagement. At fitvia in Wiesbaden, I gained hands-on experience in CRM, social media, communication and customer support – I could experience how targeted content and tailored interactions can shape user experiences across markets.</p>
                    <p>A few months after, a small jump to Stuttgart led me to STARTUP AUTOBAHN – time to work for a global, open innovation platform. There, I challenged myself in online/onsite event planning, communication strategy, PR, copywriting and community management, coordinating international startup–corporate collaborations.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <h2>The Shift</h2>
                    <p>AI, emerging technologies and data governance – was this the direction I wanted to take? Indeed it was. With a one-way ticket to Brussels, I joined the International Association Privacy Professionals, where I expanded my expertise in digital content creation, creative marketing and copywriting, event and customer support.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <h2>Inclusive Neurotech</h2>
                    <p>A piece of the puzzle was still missing. I was working in an interesting field, but the desire for impact and advocacy for which Brussels is known was still pushing me. I found a partial answer in some volunteering – which led me to more specialization.</p>
                    <p>In the past two years, I found brain health and neurotechnology to be my go-to. I combined courses on neuroscience, digital health data management and mental conditions with volunteering in the assistive technologies field and neurodiversity – eureka! That was my call: how can neurotechnologies, digital tools and AI support mental well being respecting ethics, autonomy and cognitive liberty?</p>
