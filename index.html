            <h2>The “talk me about yourself” question</h2>
            <p>Where to start? What to highlight? Well, let me walk you through my academic, professional and volunteering story first – so that you can decide what to deepen after.</p>
            <p>We always communicate something – it can be about any topic, anytime. In my case, I decided to communicate for a living, and here I am: writing and speaking about privacy, AI, data governance, neurotechnology and psychology through the lenses of culture and diversity. My goal is to contribute shaping the future of brain health technology in a more inclusive and culturally/socially relevant way.</p>

            <h2>Where it all begun: Languages, Culture and Marketing</h2>
            <p>I studied foreign languages (apart from English and Italian, I speak German, Spanish and Portuguese; French is on the way!), and international communication across Italy, Germany and Norway. My focus was marketing – including PR and advertising – and how people from different languages, places and cultures understand them.</p>
            <p>A new product that needs to be adapted to different European or international markets? No problem – I got an analysis and strategy ready for this.</p>

            <h2>Getting started – first experiences across Europe</h2>
            <p>My first professional steps were rooted in digital communication and customer engagement. At fitvia in Wiesbaden, I gained hands-on experience in CRM, social media, communication and customer support – I could experience how targeted content and tailored interactions can shape user experiences across markets.</p>
            <p>A few months after, a small jump to Stuttgart led me to STARTUP AUTOBAHN – time to work for an global, open innovation platform. There, I challenged myself in online/onsite event planning, communication strategy, PR, copywriting and community management, coordinating international startup–corporate collaborations. It was a fast-paced environment – great to strengthen my ability to plan, manage and communicate complex projects across borders.</p>

            <h2>Entering the world of Privacy, AI and Data Governance</h2>
            <p>AI, emerging technologies and data governance – was this the direction I wanted to take? Indeed it was. With a one-way ticket to Brussels, I joined the International Association Privacy Professionals, where I expanded my expertise in digital content creation, creative marketing and copywriting, event and customer support. I was not only exposed to the topics I was interested in, but I could also build a holistic understanding of global privacy and operations/technology frameworks through multiple trainings.</p>

            <h2>Deepening my mission: balancing expertise and personal values</h2>
            <p>A piece of the puzzle was still missing. I was working in an interesting field, but the desire for impact and advocacy for which Brussels is known was still pushing me. I found a partial answer in some volunteering – which led me to more specialization.</p>
            <p>In the past two years, I found brain health and neurotechnology to be my go to. I combined courses on neuroscience, digital health data management and mental conditions with volunteering in the assistive technologies field and neurodiversity – eureka! That was my call: how can neurotechnologies, digital tools and AI support mental well being respecting ethics, autonomy and cognitive liberty?</p>

            <h2>Today and Tomorrow</h2>
            <p>Today, I am building a career at the intersection of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Marketing and communication</li>
                <li>Privacy, AI governance and data management</li>
                <li>Brain health, neuroscience and psychology</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For my career, I wish to grow into international project management (that is also on the way!), to lead impactful marketing and communication projects in the field of brain health technologies, combining creativity with ethical governance and scientific insight.</p>

            <p>I got you – visit the other section of the website
                 (<a href="projects.html">Projects and Portfolio</a>), it is all there.</p>
